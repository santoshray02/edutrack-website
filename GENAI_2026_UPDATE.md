## 💰 Pricing Strategy

### Why Increased Prices?
1. **GenAI API Costs**: LLM inference costs ~₹2-5K per school/year
2. **Market Positioning**: GenAI commands premium (30-40% higher than basic software)
3. **Value Justification**: Comparison table shows you're still cheaper than competitors
4. **Feature Parity**: Now matching 2026 market expectations

### Competitive Analysis
- **Manual/Excel**: ₹5-10K (but 100s of hours wasted)
- **Basic Software**: ₹35-50K (no GenAI)
- **EduTrack GenAI**: ₹18-48K (full GenAI + Agentic AI)

**Your advantage**: GenAI at 40% lower cost than competitors

---

## 🎯 Go-To-Market Strategy

### Target Messaging
1. **For Principals**: "Ask questions in Hindi, get instant answers"
2. **For Accountants**: "Voice record payments while on the move"
3. **For Directors**: "Predict dropouts before they happen"
4. **For Tech-Savvy**: "ChatGPT-level AI, built for schools"

### Sales Pitch
```
"2026 is the year of GenAI. While others give you software with menus and buttons,
EduTrack gives you a conversation. Ask in Hindi, speak naturally, let our AI agent
work 24/7 for you. It's like having ChatGPT, but for your school data.

Starting ₹18,000/year - 40% cheaper than competitors, with full GenAI features
that they charge extra for."
```

### Objection Handling

**Q: "Is this really GenAI or just automation?"**
A: "Open our demo and ask 'कक्षा 8 के कितने छात्रों ने फीस नहीं दी?' - you'll get a conversational response with insights, not a filtered table. That's LLM-powered GenAI."

**Q: "Why is it more expensive than before?"**
A: "We added ChatGPT-level conversational AI, voice commands in Hindi/English, and an autonomous AI agent that works 24/7. These features cost competitors ₹50K+/year."

**Q: "Can I trust AI with my school data?"**
A: "The AI reads your data to give insights, but all data stays in your secure database. The AI agent follows your rules - you stay in control."
